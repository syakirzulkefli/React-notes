## Understanding the state hooks
State hook used to add state to a component
* React updates state asynchronously(meaning not immediately)(for perfomamnce reason)
* State is stored outside of components in memory
* Use hooks at the top level of our component

if function called 10 times,the result shoud be the same 10 times but if it's changed it will be recognized as impure.

If the components is pure react will skip re-rendering.

To make sure our components pure is by keep changes out of the rendering phase
